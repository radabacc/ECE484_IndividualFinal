# ECE484_IndividualFinal

The display mainly consists of bringing in all of the different sensors to determine point values or when the game is over or not. This part mainly consists of communication between Arduinos using either SPI, UART, Wifi or bluetooth ( using wireless hats.) The display will have an LCD_I2C to display point values and signal whether the game is over. Maybe play some sort of noise when the game is over to signify it.
